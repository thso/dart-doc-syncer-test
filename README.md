Template Syntax
---------------

Welcome to the example application used in angular.io/dart's
[Template Syntax](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html) page.

To run your own copy:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Download the dependencies:

  `pub get`
3. Launch a development server:

  `pub serve`
4. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.<br/>
  In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
  you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
