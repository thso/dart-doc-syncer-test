Template Syntax
---------------

Welcome to the example application used in angular.io/dart's [Template Syntax](null) page.

You can run a [hosted copy](www.template-syntax-link.com) of thissample. Or run your own copy:

- Clone this repo.
- Download the dependencies.
    ```
    pub get
    ```
- Launch a development server.
    ```
    pub serve
    ```
- Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
  In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers, you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
